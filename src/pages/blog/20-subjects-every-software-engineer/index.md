Here are the most important subjects for software engineering, with brief explanations:   
**1.Object oriented analysis & design**: For better maintainability, reusability and faster development,  the most well accepted approach, shortly [OOAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design) and its [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) principals are very important for software engineering.   
**2.Software quality factors**: Software engineering depends on some very important [quality factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality). Understanding and applying them is crucial.   
**3.Data structures & algorithms**: Basic [data structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) like array, list, stack, tree, map, set etc. and useful [algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms) are vital for software development. Their logical structure should be known.   
**4**. **Big-O notation: **[Big-O notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) indicates the performance of an algorithm/code section. Understanding it is very important for comparing performances.   
**5.UML notation**: [UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) is the universal and complete language for software design & analysis. If there is lack of UML in a development process, it feels there is no engineering.   
**6.Software processes and metrics**: Software enginnering is not a random process. It requires a high level of systematic and some numbers to monitor those techniques. So, [processes ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)and [metrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_metric) are essential.   
**7.Design patterns**: [Design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) are standard and most effective solutions for specific problems. If you don't want to reinvent the wheel, you should learn them.   
**8.Operating systems basics**: Learning [OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) basics is very important because all applications runs on it. By learning it, we can have better vision, viewpoints and performance for our applications.   
**9.Computer organization basics**: All applications including OS requires a hardware for physical interaction. So, learning [computer organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture) basics is vital again for better vision, viewpoints and performance.   
**10.Network basics**: [Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) is related with computer organization, OS and the whole information transfer process. In any case we will face it while software development. So, it is important to learn network basics.   
**11.Requirement analysis**: [Requirement analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis) is the starting point and one of the most important parts of software engineering. Performing it correctly and practically needs experience but it is very essential.   
**12.Software testing**: [Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) is another important part of software engineering. [Unit testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), its [best practices](http://richard.jp.leguen.ca/tutoring/soen343-f2010/tutorials/properties-of-good-unit-tests) and techniques like black box, white box, mocking, [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), integration testing etc. are subjects which must be known.   
**13.Dependency management**: Library (JAR, DLL etc.) management, and widely known tools (Maven, Ant,  Ivy etc.) are essential for large projects. Otherwise, antipatterns like [Jar Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Classloader#JAR_hell) are inevitable.   
**14.Continuous integration**: [Continuous integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) brings easiness and automaticity for testing large modules, components and also performs auto-versioning. Its aim and tools (like [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org/) etc.) should be known.   
**15.ORM (Object relational mapping)**: [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) and its widely known implementation Hibernate framework is an important technique for mapping objects into database tables. It reduces code length and maintenance time.   
**16.DI (Dependency Injection)**: [DI or IoC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) (Inversion of Control) and its widely known implementation Spring framework makes life easy for object creation and lifetime management on big enterprise applications.   
**17.Version controlling systems**: [VCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) tools (SVN, TFS, CVS etc.) are very important by saving so much time for collaborative works and versioning. Their logical viewpoint and standard cammands should be known.    
**18.Internationalization (i18n)**: [i18n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) by extracting strings into external files is the best way of supporting multiple languages in our applications. Its practices on different IDEs and technologies must be known.   
**19.Architectural patterns**: Understanding [architectural design patterns](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/42830/Model-View-Controller-Model-View-Presenter-and-Mod) (like MVC, MVP, MVVM etc.) is essential for producing a maintainable, clean, extendable and testable source code.   
**20.Writing clean code**: Working code is not enough, it must be readable and maintainable also. So, [code formatting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint) and [readable code](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/top-15-best-practices-for-writing-super-readable-code/) development techniques are needed to be known and applied.

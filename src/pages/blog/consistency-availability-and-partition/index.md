**CAP theorem**Â is a theory in Distributed Computing.

  

The theory claims that there is no system that provides all three Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance. For example, replications must be made in multiple nodes to increase usability, and the adjustability between replicated data must be met. However, in order to make operation possible, even during network partitioning, it becomes difficult to guarantee the adjustability between replications or data. Therefore, only a part of the CAP can be provided.

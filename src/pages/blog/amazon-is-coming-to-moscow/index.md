> Hi Ivan,  
> I came across your profile and wanted to let you know that the Amazon is heading to Moscow the February 20th – 28th (2013) with a team of engineers and hiring managers to conduct interviews for Software Development Engineer opportunities that are currently available on couple of teams. These are the teams that are working on the latest technology, have the highest visibility and continuously strive to reinvent consumer experience as a product or platform. In an effort to make considering an opportunity with Amazon a bit easier, we're bringing the interview team to the you!   
> If you are curious about the roles that we are hiring for, I’d be happy to share more information on next steps and what to expect. We believe good engineers refer good engineers so, if you know of anyone who may be interested in considering opportunities with us at Amazon, please feel free to forward my information along, as we are looking to fill 80+ technical and engineering roles in the near future!   
> Please note that all of our roles are Full time positions located in Seattle, WA, in the United States, so you would need to be willing to consider relocation.   
> Thanks and I hope to hear back from you with an updated copy of your resume to [vssridha@amazon.com](mailto:vssridha@amazon.com)!

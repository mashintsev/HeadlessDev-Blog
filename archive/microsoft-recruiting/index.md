> Hi Ivan,  
> My name is Pavithra and I'm a Recruiter for the Bing Search Team at Microsoft. We're holding a recruiting event soon in Moscow mid October 2013 recruiting for roles based in Bellevue, WA and when I saw your background and experience I thought you might appreciate learning about the opportunity.  
> Your first thoughts may be that you’re happy where you are at the moment, however I would love the opportunity to provide you with information on these once in a life-time roles that may pleasantly surprise you. I’d like to know what motivates you: Is it intellectual challenges, reaching tens of millions of users; disruptive technology; breadth and depth of responsibilities; money; career growth?

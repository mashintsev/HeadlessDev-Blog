Over the years I've come across various great posts on the internet related to programming. A lot of those I consider essential reading for programmers. So I shall be sharing a list of blog posts over here, some essential, some not(but still good reads).

1.  [Learning to Code: The Roadmap I Wish I Had Been Given](http://jimmy-li.net/blog/programming/how-to-get-started-in-web-development/) \- Just read this one today. More relevant to beginners with no or very little programming background.
2.  [How I Became a Programmer](http://mattdeboard.net/2011/11/23/how-i-became-a-programmer/) \- A post in the same vein as the first one.
3.  [Why can't Programmers... Program?](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html) \- On the importance of knowing the little things, by Jeff Atwood, cofounder of StackExchange, the Q&A framework we're using in the Udacity Forums.
4.  [Recursion Explained with the Flood Fill Algorithm (and Zombies and Cats)](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/), a very good explanation of Recursion by Al Sweigart, the writer of[Invent Your own Computer Games with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/).
5.  [Principles of Good Programming](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531)
6.  [Teach Yourself Programming in 10 Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), by Peter Norvig - **MUST READ**
7.  [Become a Good Programmer in Six Really Hard Steps](http://www.gamedev.net/blog/355/entry-2250592-become-a-good-programmer-in-six-really-hard-steps/), a good follow up on the Peter Norvig post **MUST READ**
8.  [How to RTFM - Tips for a life of discovery](http://blog.appamatto.com/2011/11/22/how-to-rtfm.html) \- Stuck at a problem? Solution - search google(or ask on the forums). No! That's the worst you could do. **R**ead **T**he **F**---ing **M**anual! (:P)

12.  [A Visual Guide to Version Control](http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/) \- If you stick to programming for more than a while, then you're eventually going to end up using(if you don't, then you should) Version control.

From Chapter 1 - Introduction : _This document is a collection of slang terms used by various subcultures of computer hackers. Though some technical material is included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary; what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for fun, social communication, and technical debate._ The[download page](http://catb.org/jargon/download.html), if you are interested.

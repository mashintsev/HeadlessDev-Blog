During learning a Natural Language Processing [course](https://class.coursera.org/nlp/class) I found great reading for unix users. It's book about how processing billon words.  
  
Content:  
  

  
  
1\. Count words in a text  

2\. Sort a list of words in various ways  

*   ascii order  
    
*   dictionary order  
    
*   ‘‘rhyming’’ order  
    3\. Extract useful info from a dictionary 4. Compute ngram statistics  
    5\. Make a Concordance

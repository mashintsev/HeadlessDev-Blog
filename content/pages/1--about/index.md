### Who am I?

My name is Ivan. I am a Software Engineer. I'm using different technologies for creating smart and great software products. 

### What is it about?

This blog is an educational project.

I will share with you what I have learnt. I expect that will strengthen my understanding of subjects I will write about. I also hope that you find it helpful.

So once again, it is an eductional project. For sure for me, but chances are for you also. :)

### The English language

One more thing, English is not my native language, so please be understanding if you find any mistake or unclear words in my writings. The code of this website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/mashintsev/HeadlessDev-Blog) so if you want to correct my English you can make a PR. Thank you.
